// ! instance.
 instance isnothing but a virtual server
for running applicationson Amazon ec2.
It can also be understoodlike a tiny part
of a larger computer tiny part which has
its own Hardware networkconnection operating system.
Cetera, but it is actually virtual in nature.
So  
when I saya virtual server running
that ISbasically hosts our application is

What do I mean by a virtualinstance a virtual presence
Well guys when you talk about

software development elopementapplication development.

What you do is you are supposedto build an applications and run

those on servers right?

But at times there are a lotof constraints like the space

that you use the resources

that you want to usesay for example,

certain applications runon Windows certain run

on Mac OS and certain runon your Ubuntu OS right?

So in that case,

I cannot always go aheadand have different systems

and different operating systemson them and then

run my applicationson top of that right

because it is time consuming.

Stu and also consumesa lot of money

that you invest into it.

So what isthe solution for that?

What if I could havea single device

and on top of which I couldcreate virtual compartments

in which I could storemy data differently

store my applications runmy applications differently.

Wouldn't that be nice?

Well, when you talkabout an instance,

that is what it exactlydoes you can think of it

as a tiny part of a computer.

Well, that is what it is time to symbolize.

I mean you have a systemon top of which.

You can run different applications and how it works is

if you are running an application a in part

1 and running an application B

in Part B of your server these applications have a feeling
that they are running individually on that system

and there is no other systemrunning on top of it.

So this is what virtualization is.

It creates a virtual environmentfor your application to run

and one such instance

of this virtual environmentis called as an instance.

// ! Virtulization

It can be a simple computer

which is shared by differentpeople and those people

are working quiteindependently on that server.

That is whatvirtualization is that is

what an instances in this imagethe second image each All

of this individual would beusing a different instance.

So this is what an instance is

when you talkabout virtualization.


// ! EC2
It is an Amazonweb services compute service.
It stands Elastic  compute Cloud.

Now, what do I mean by this?

When you sayan elastic Cloud compute?

That means basically it isa service with lets you

actually go ahead and CarryOut computation practice

and when I say elastic it means

that it is fairly resizableand fairly reusable.

Once we get into the demo part

probably you'd getva better picture.

What do I mean by elasticity?

Because it is highlyflexible highly scalable.

It is very cost efficientand it serves a lot of purposes.



// ! scalable -
when you talk abouta cloud platform one
of its best features is it givesyou high amount of scalability?
That means your applicationscan scale up.
Down depending upon the data
that you want to useon top of it.
So if the traffic increasesmore you need more performance.
So your applicationshould be able to scale
to those needs, right?
So that is what cloud computingprovides you with and
that is what ec2 also providesyou with when I say an instance.
Basically, what you're doingis you're launching
a virtual machine.
It is called as instancein terms of AWS.
So this virtual machineshould be scalable.
That means it should scale up
and scale down bothin terms of memory.
A storage and even in termsof the computation
that it is providing.
So when you talk about EC2 it is highly scalable.
Once we get into the demo partyou would see this now
it being scalable
and it being cost-efficientmakes it highly flexible.
So that is the third Point.
Let us try and understandthe second Point as well.

// ! costefficient -
What easy to does isit lets you scale up
and down I just mention
that right so instead
of buying Number of instancesor instead of buying a number
of services youcan actually go ahead
and scale this instance up anddown with minimal cost changes.
So you're saving money
because apart from that thereare burstable instances.
There are various pricing modelsthat ec2 boasts of using
which you can actuallysave a lot of money
as we move further.


// EC2  is a computation serviceand it takes care of Of following pointers.
// I mean it is easily resizable.
// It is cost efficient.
// It is highly scalable
// and all these features makeit highly flexible as well.


// ! typesof instances 

when you talk abouteasy to it is one
of the oldest AWS services.
So if you talk aboutthe type of instances
that are there in the market.
Well, there arequite a few types
of instances that you can deal
with and these are someof the popular ones
Once I move into the demo part,
I would maybe talkabout other instances
but to keep it simple
basically these instancesthey have different families.
I mean, you have
the T Series you havethe M series The C series.
Well, basically these series
consists of different kind of instances

that serve different purposesto simplify this process.
What AWS has doneis it has gone ahead

and categorized these instancesinto following types.

// 1.) general purpose instance.

Now it is basicallysuited for applications

that require a balanceof performance and cost

that means places where yourequire quick responses,

but it is still cost-effective.

I mean say for example

the example shown hereemail response systems.

Now you require a quick response

and there will be nnumber of responses

or n number of emails

that would pop in but you do not want

to pay a lot of money for this kind of service.

So in this case you needcost optimization as well

and you need Quickresponse as well.

So this is where your general purpose instances come

into picture next on this list.

// ! compute instance.

Now what a computeinstances these are

for applications that requirea lot of processing.

Now when you say

computation they havebetter computation power.

That means if there is a lot of data that need

quicker computation power youcan use these kind of instances.

What is an example.

You have your analyzingstreaming data now

if you know,

what stream Datais it is the data

that continuously flowsin and flows out.

That means you are streaming the data say

for example this session itis being streamed, right?

I mean the information

or whatever is happeninghere it is going live.

So in order to processthis kind of data,

you need systems that giveyou good computation power
which are very activeand very good in nature.

So when you talkabout compute instances,

they provide you with these kindof services and that is why



// ! memory instances.



These are the instances thatare required for applications

that require more memoryor in better terms more RAM,

right random access memory.

So these are for applications

that require goodcomputation power again,

like the previous one,

but when you talk about Ram,

it is something that residesin your local system, right?

So you need instances.

Which have good memory capacity

and what kindof application it serves?

Well, you canthink of applications

that need multitasking multiprocessing say for example,

I need a single system

that does fetching data forme as well process it for me

as well dashboardit for me as well

and then gives it tothe End customer as well.

So these kind of applications

require memory instancesmoving further guys.

// ! storage instancesas 

These applications are

or these instances arefor applications that require.

You to store hugeamounts of data.

Say for example,

you have large size applicationslike your big data applications

where the amountof data is used number.

So you would be requiring morestorage more storage flexibility

in that case.

You can opt for instancesthat are specifically

optimized for storagekind of requirements.

// ! GPU instances.
if you are interestedin graphical kind of work
where you have basicallyA heavy Graphics rendering
in that case you can optfor GPU kind of instances
which basically help yousir purposes like 3D modeling
and stuff like that.

So guys, this was aboutthe different kind of instances.



// ! what are the differentinstance pricing models

Yes Cloud does support applications in such a way
that you would spend very
less amount but it involvesa lot of planning guys.
So each time you usea particular service.
It is veryimportant to understand.
How does thatparticular service work?
And if you actually planin the services in that manner
you would actually endup saving a lot of money.
So let us try and understand
how the pricing models work when you talk about it.
See two in particular.
So Guys.
These are someof the pricing models
that EC2 to has to offer to you.
// 1.) on demand
// 2.) dedicated 
// 3.) on  spot
// 4.) reserved instances.


when you say an on-demandinstance as the name suggests,
it is an instance that you demand and you get it.
Now these instancesare made available to you
for a limited time framesay for example,
I need a particular instance for an hourly basis.
So I would be wanting to use that instance
for only that Durasian.
So to use that instance for that particular duration.
What I do is I actually go ahead and demand this instance.

So a tub -

would give me that instancebut it would work for

an are only

so my prices for that instancewould be fixed on that manner.

I mean the fact

that I would be usingit for one instance
or for an one are basically
so I would be charged onlyfor that one hour.
And once that are

is complete that instanceit gets Terminated on its own

it's similar to renting a flatfor one month suppose

if I move to a new city

and I'm lookingsomething temporary say,

for example, I'mlooking for a hostel

or a paying guest kindof a living system.

Right?

So in that case,

what I would do is I wouldup front go and tell the owner

that I would be stayinghere for a month.

You can charge mefor a month only

if it is 1000 morethan normal charge.

It is fine.

But once the month is over,

I would like to leaveright so that kind of service

or that kind of instance.

Demand is called

as on-demand instances basically 

// ! Dedicated .

These instances arekind of given to

a particular organization

so that their security is defined better

than other say for example,

if I need to protect my data,

I need my data to be privatized Now understand this thing AWS

or the other Cloud platforms are highly secure.

Your data is secure no matter

whether they areon dedicated instance or not.

But what happens is you normally share your Space

with someone else data remains private

but there are companies

that deal with highly confidential data.

And in that case they wantthat extra Assurance as an okay.

I am using a spacewhich is not shared by anyone.

So in that case you have dedicated instances,

which basically serve your needs like high security

and basically an isolation from the other vendors as well.

So that is what dedicated instances do they are costlier.

But yeah, they give you that isolation on spot.

// ! on spot 

it is like bidding say for example,

I am buying a particular share.

So I havea particular budget right

so I might havea budget of $300.

So what I do is I go ahead and buy the chair

and I sat in a capas an okay to the max

I can bid for $300 for the share.

So if the price goes above 300 dollars,

I'm not taking that share right?

So if there is a particular instance you can bid

for that instance as an okay.

This is the maximum price that I pay for this.

Ernst so if that instanceis available at that price

it is given to you

and if after a particularduration the price

of this instance can change

so it is available to you for a limited period of time.

So if you are dealingwith data that is volatile

and you want to workon the data  in real-time,

so you cannot for this instance

because after a while the priceof this instance might change

and this instancemight be terminated

and you might not be ableto use it for a longer while

but the thing it doesis it is available

to you at a cheaper price?

And at the pricing bitthat you put on it,

so that is why itis more affordable.

But again, it is good

for volatile data only 

// ! Reserved Instance.

It is like rentingan apartment on a lease

for a longer period right?

I mean suppose

if I am getting a flaton an agreement will basis

where I signan agreement for a year.

That means Iam reserving this flat

for one complete year, right?

So nobody elsein comments say that okay,

you have to vacate this.

A flat right sothat is one benefit.

And the other thing is you have a fixed set of rent.

So if you're taking somethingfor a longer duration,

there is a chance

that you might end up paying lesser money for that as well.

Now what happens here is

when you talk about it from the instance perspective suppose,

you know that you would be needing

this much configurationfor this duration.

You can rent that particular instance for that duration,

and probably you end upsaving a lot of money now

when you talk about AWS it gives you Latif

where you can actually go ahead

and upscale downscaleyour instances to your needs.

You can kinda terminate stuff and move to the next up.

But if you are certain about certain things as an okay,

I have to use this no matter

what happens for a longerduration in that case.

You can offer reserved kind

of instances and those aremore affordable to you.

So Guys, these weredifferent types of instances

based on the pricingthat is there.



// ! Generalclusterization of instances,

like the general-purpose

the GPU that was basedon They're functioning,

right then we learned aboutthe pricing models as well.

Now.

// ! General functioning.

burstable instance,
we've talked about generalpurpose instances, right?

So what happens is there isa category of General.

But was instances with start

with a base utilization power available to you.

That means if you want to utilize your CPU

for a certain amount burstable instances are good here.

Let me throw in some more lightas in what am I talking about?

Exactly suppose.

I need a CPU utilization of 20% And I know that

so I can go for burstable instances.

What they do is they start

with the functioning of 20% but in case

if I'm dealing with data

that It is not constant

that might change with time say for example,

if my website experiences more traffic,

so I might need more performance.

Right?

So in that case

what burstable instances do is they burst

out of their current performance to 100% CPU utilization

so that you can get more performance.

Now what happens here is youare charged a particular amount

for these instances

and you have certain credits for which you can use

the burst people performance and if you do not use the bustable.

Performance those credits can be used later as well.

So you are getting optimize performance as well.

And you are saving some money as well in case

if there is an urgent traffic

that you experience youhave something called

// ! as EBS optimized now

when you talk about EBS optimized now,

these are the applications

where basically youare processing data

at a higher speed.

Say for example,there is some application

where the data is flowing in continuously.

So I need quick response, right?

So EBS backed up or EBS optimized instances.

What they do is they give you high input output processing

and that is why these are good instances to art

for these situations 

// ! cluster networking.

Basically, they form clusters

of instances nowa particular cluster

what it does is it serves one kind of purpose say

for example in my application.

What I want is I have different sections

and in different sections my first section requires

To be processing data at a faster rate.

The other one.

I wanted to be storage

optimized so I can Define different clusters

of instances that serve different purposes here.

And then I have the dedicated one.

We've already talked about dedicated one.

It is more relatedto the data security part.

So Guys, these were the different types of instances.

I know I've talkedabout a lot of stuff

once we get into the demo part

probably this would ease upa little more for you people.

I believe you people are

with me and you are following this session.

//  ! use case

so that we can just move further

and take a look at the demo partas well for this use case.

I've considereda ederecho itself.

Let us try and understand

what could bethe possible problems

that can be solved by using these instances.

Now imagine that

if it is Erica used AWSas their Cloud partner

and they used the ec2 service.

So what kind of problems couldbe solved by these instances

that we just talked

about suppose we havethe first problem

where you have To analyzethe data of the customer.

So what kind of application would you use?

Can you guess that for me?

I won't be lookingat your answers.

Let me just quickly go ahead and give you other examples as

well so that we can discuss these one by one suppose.

You also have an auto responsible system now compare

these two and let me know which one

would you believe would be served better

by these instances thatwe've just talked about.

So when you talkabout the performance here guys

// analysis of data for the customers data - burstable performs.

// rightauto response email system.- I do not wantto invest a lot of money EBS optimized instances

//  browsingand search engine - clustered Network instances,

// confidential data. - dedicated instances here.
