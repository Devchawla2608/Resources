Cloud computing is at the cuspof technological advancement.
And when you talk about cloudcomputing it cannot shy away
without mentioningAmazon web services (AWS),
which is one of the leadingcloud service providers
in the market.
If you are looking for a careerin this domain you have landed
at the right place Edurekabrings you a complete course
on Amazon web services,
which not only touchesupon the fundamental
but also die.
It's deeper ata conceptual level.
So let us take a lookat the offerings
of this session first.

We would start with thefundamentals of cloud computing
and Amazon web servicesmoving on we will talk
about the core services
that Amazon web serviceshas to offer to you.
The first domain isthe compute domain

where we would be exploringservices like ec2.

Elastic Beanstalkand Lambda moving on.
We'll talk aboutthis storage domain
where we'll be exploringservices like S3 EFS and Next
in line is the networking domain

where we'll be talking aboutservices like VPC Route 53 Etc.

// ! why Cloud 

this we need to understandthe situation that existed
before Cloud came into existence.So what happened back then and firstly in order to host a website you
have to buy a stack of servers and we all know that servers are very costly.So that meant we ended up
paying a lot of money next was the issue of traffic now as we all know if you are hosting a websitewe are dealing with traffic that is not constantt hroughout the day and that meant more pain we would understand that as we move further.And the otherthing was monitoring and maintaining your servers.

This is a very big problemnow all these issues.

They led to certain disadvantages.

What are those

as I mentioned serversare very costly.

Yes.

The setup was again costly

and thus you ended up being a lot of money

and there were other factors contributing to this point.

Let's discuss those as well.

One troubleshooting wasa big issue since you're dealing

with a business your Prime Focusis on taking good decisions

so that you have Business does well,

but if you end up troubleshooting problems

or you focus more on infrastructure related issues,

then you cannot focus more on your business

and that was a problem. 

So either you had to do multitasking

or you have to hiremore people to focus

on those issues thus again you ended up being more money

as I've discussed the traffic on a website is never constant.

And since it varies you are not certain about its patterns.

Say, for example,

I need to host a websiteand for that what I

decided is I am reserving.

To petabytes of total memory formy usage based on the traffic

but as the traffic where is there would be times

when the traffic is high

and my whole to petabytesof data is consumed

or space is consumed Roger,

but what if the traffic

is very low for certainhours of the day.

I'm actually notutilizing these servers.

So I end up payingmore money for the servers

than I should be.

So yes upscaling was an issue.

So all these thingswere an issue

because we were paying more money.

We do not have sufficient time to Take our decisions properly.

There was ambiguity.

There was more troublemonitoring and maintaining

all these resources and apart from that one important point

which we need to conside ris the amount of data

that is being generated now

and that was being generated then then it was okay,

but nowadays if you take a look at it the amount of data

that is generated is huge

and this is another reason why Cloud became so important as

of mentioned the data now,

we all know that every thing is going online these days

and what that means is we shop online.

And we buy food online.

We do almost everything

that is required asan whatever information we need.

We get everything onlinebookings and reservations.

Everything can be taken care ofthat means we have a lot of data

that is being generatedthese days and this

is Digital Data back in those times.

We were communicating through verbal discussions

and all those things so

through paperwork and that wasa different data to maintain

since everything is moving

on cloud or moving online the amount of data

that we have is used these days.

Days, and then when you have this huge amount of data,

you need a space

where you can actually go aheadand maintain this data.

So yes again,

there was a need of this pieceand all these issues

that is your cost.

You're monitoring your maintenance providing

sufficient space.

Everything was takencare by Cloud.

So let us try to understandwhat this cloud is exactly.

Well think of it as a huge space

that is availableonline for your usage.

Now.

This is a very generic definition to give you

to be more specific.

I would be seeing that.

Think of it as a collection

of data centers nowdata centers again at a place

where you store your data or youhost applications basically,

so when you talkabout these data centers,

they were already existing.

So what didCloud do differently?

Well, what clouddid was it made sure

that you are able

to orchestrate your variousfunctionings applications

managing your resources properly

by combining allthese data centers together

through a network

and then providingyou the the control

to use this resources

and to manage them properlyto make it even more simpler.

I would say there was a groupof people or organizations.

Basically that went aheadand what these servers

these compute capacitiesstorage places compute services

and all those things

and they have their ownchannel or Network.

All you have to do was go ahead

and rent those resources onlyto the amount you need it

and also for the timethat you needed.

So yes, this is what clouddid It let you rent the services

that you need and useonly those services

that you need.

So you ended up payingfor the services

that you rented and you endedup saving a lot of money.

The other thing isthese service providers.

They take care of all the issues

like your securityyour underlying infrastructures

and all those things.

So you can freely focuson your business

and stop worryingabout all these issues.

So this is what cloud isin simple words.

It's a huge space which hasall these services available

and you can just go aheadand pick and read.

And those servicesthat you want to use so

// ! what is cloud computing?
 an ability or it is a place where youcan actually store your data. You can process it and you can access it from anywhere in the world.
 it makes the worldaccessible it lets. All you need is a goodAnd a connection.

//! Different service models.
There are certain people who just want to consume a particular resourceor there's certain people 
who actually wantto to go ahead and create their own applicationsgreat the own infrastructure and all those things. So based on these needs wehave particular service models that is your Cloudproviders provide you with a particular model which suits your needs.

// * we have these three models

1.) iaas
2.) paas 
3.) saas.

// ! Saas, or SAS - software-as-a-service.
//  you're just consuming a service which is alreadybeing maintained and handled by someone else example We have a Gmail.

// All you do is you send mail topeople and you receive mails and whatever functionality you do is you just use the service
// that is there.
// You do not have to maintain it.
// You do not have to worryabout up scaling down
// scalings security issuesand all those things.
// Everything is taken careby Google say for example,
// now this model is knownas software as a service
// that is saas.

// ! PaaS - Platform As a Service
//  that is platform as a servicenow here you are provided with a platform where you can actually go aheadand build your own applications to give you an example. We have our Google app engine. Now when you talkabout Google app engine,
// what you can do isyou can go ahead.
// You can createyour own applications
// and you can put iton Google app engine so
// that others can use it as well.
// So in short you're usingthe app platform to create
// your own applications,

// ! IaaS -  infrastructureas a service.
// Well, the whole infrastructureis provided to you
// so that you can go ahead andcreate your own applications.
// That is an underlying structureis given to you based on that.
// You can go ahead and chooseyour operating systems
// the kind of Technology
// on to use on that platformthe applications you want
// to build an All those things
// so that is what an iaasis infrastructure-as-a-service



Everything as far as your pastis concerned your data  and applications aretaken care by you.
That is you can go ahead youcan build your own applications.
You can usethe existing platform
that is provided to you.
And finally you have your iaas.


// ! Deployment Models
when you talk about deployment models you
can also call All them asdifferent types of clouds
that are there in the marketwe have these three types.
1.) public Cloud
2.) your private cloud
3.) hybrid Cloud.

public Cloud it's available
to everyone you havea service provider
who makes these servicesor these resources available
to people worldwidethrough the internet.
It is an easy and very
inexpensive way of dealingwith the situation
because all you have to dois you have to go ahead
and rent this cloudand you're good to you.
And it is available publicly.

// ! private Cloud.

This is a little different here.
You are providedwith this service
and you can actuallygo ahead and create
your own applications.
And since it's a private Cloudyou are protected by a firewall
and you do not have to worryabout various other issues
that are there at hand and next.

// ! hybrid Cloud 
it is a combinationof your private cloud
and your public Cloud say,
for example, you can go aheadand build your applications
privately you can use them.
You can consume them youcan use them efficiently.
When you sense that peakin your traffic.
You can actuallymove it to public
that is you can move itto the public cloud
and even others can have accessto it and they can use it.

So these are the three basic deployment models


// ! Different Cloudproviders
Cloud came into existence.
Quite a few people went ahead
and they bought their owninfrastructure and now they rent
the services to other people
and when you talk
about this infrastructurethe quite a few people out there
who are actually providingthese cloud services
to different peopleacross the globe.
Now, when you talkabout these Cloud providers,
the first thing
that should come to your mindis Amazon web services
because it is highly popular
and it leaves otherCloud providers way behind.
The reason I'm sayingthis is the numbers
that talk about Amazon webservices to You an example
if you talk aboutits compute capacity.
It is six times larger than allthe other service providers
that are there in the marketsay for example,
if you talk about the otherservice providers in the market,
if the compute capacity combined
was X Amazon web services alonegives you a capacity of 6 x
which is huge apart from that.
It's flexible pricingand various other reasons.
That is the services it providesand all those things.
It is rightly a globalleader and the fact
that it had a head start.
It started way
before many other servicesthat are there in the market.
It actually gained popularity.
And now we see quitea few organizations going ahead
and using Amazon web servicesapart from that.

// ! Microsoft Azure,
which is a Microsoft productand we all know
that when Microsoft decidesto do something they 

second best

it is still a verygood cloud service provider

that is there in the market.

// ! Google Cloud platform 
We all know the infrastructur
that Google has to offerto you it has one
of the best search engine
that is then the market
and the amount of data they dealwith every day is huge.
So they are the Pioneerswhen you talk about Data
and all those thingsand they know
how to actually handlethis amount of data and
how to have an infrastructurethat is very good.
That is why they have a very good facility and that leads
to it being one of the cheapest service providers in the market.
There are certain featuresthat GCB offers
which are better.
Even than Amazon web serviceswhen you talk about its pricing
and the reason for it isit has various other services
that are there water does is ithelps you optimize various costs
how it uses analyticsand various other ways
by which it can optimizethe amount of power you use
and that leadsto less usage of power.
And since you arepaying less for power
that is provided as a paying
less for power you end up payingless for your services as well.
So that is why it isso cost efficient.

digital ocean , terramark ,IBM 
These are the major ones that
as we have Amazon web serviceswe Microsoft Azure,
we have GCP which aretalked about a lot.



// ! AWS.
 it is a complete
software suit ora cloud service provider,
which is highly secure.
It provides you with variouscompute storage database
and a number of other services,which we would be discussing.
Discussing in furtherslides as well.
And when you talkabout the market it is the best
and it has variousreasons to be the best
in the market one beingits flexibility its scalability
and its pricing other reasonsbeing its compute capacity now,
why is it so importantto compute capacity?
Well, if you talkabout the compute capacity,
you need to understand one thing
if you take all the othercloud service providers
in the market and youcombine the compute capacity
that is your layoutAWS and you take all others
into consideration
this Is would besomewhere equal to say x
and if you compare itwith AWS, it is 6X.

// ! services featuresand its uses basically,

so I would be discussingsome use cases now.

Now if you are talking about amanufacturing organization now,
the main focus isto manufacture Goods,
but most of the businessesthey focus so much
on various other services are
practices that needto be taken care of that.
They cannot focus on themanufacturing goal of this is
where aw steps--and it
takes care of all the itinfrastructure and management.
That means businesses are freeto focus on manufacturing
and they can actually go ahead
and expand a lot

// ! architecture Consulting

the main concern is prototyping and During a dove is takes care

of both the issues itlets you have automated

or speed up rendering asfar as prototyping is concerned

and that is why architecturalbusiness benefit a lot

when you talk about using AWSor any cloud provider

but AWS being the bestin the market again,

the services are

the best 
// ! media company
 nowas far as a media company
goes the main concernis generating content
and the place to dump itout to store it again,
aw takes careof all these situations
or both these situations.

// ! Large Enterprises 
when you talk
about large Enterprisestheir reach is worldwide,
so they have toreach the customers
and the employees globallyor across different places.
So AWS gives you that option
because it hasa global architecture
and your researchcan be very wide as
far as these points areconcerned the advantages of AWS
as I mentioned.

// ! Features and  advantages exactly.

it is highly flexible nowthe The reasons to support it
and one of the major reasonsis it's very cost-effective.

when you talk about flexibility,
the first concern youshould have is you are dealing
with big organizations.
They have a lot of data
that needs to be manageddeployed and taken care
of now when you talkabout a cloud provider
if it is flexible,
all these things are taken care

of the second thing is it ishighly cost-effective now when I say cost-effectiveAWS takes care 
of almost every aspect. Aspect if you area beginner or a learner, they have somethingcalled as a free tier. That means you have sufficientresources to use for free and that too for one long yearstood have sufficient Hands-On without paying anything plusit has something called as 
// ! pay-as-you-go model now
when I say pay
as you go model
what it does is it chargesyou only for the services
which are using
and only for the time being you're using them again
that lets you scale up nicely
and hence you endup paying very less
since you are being very less.
And since you haveso many options
when you are actuallybuying it Services
what that does is
that gives you a lot of flexibility scalability again,
It is very affordable.
So you're paying
on a daily basis if you're usinga particular service
for one hour you'll be payingit only for one hour.
That is how flexible it is.
And what that does is
that gives you a freedomto scale up and even scale down

since it Is easy to scale up?

It is always advisable

that you start with lessand then scale as

for your needs plus they'requite a few services

that are there which canbe automatically schedule.

Now what that means is youwould be using them only

when there is an up timeand in down time

you can miss thoseget automatically shut down

so you do not have to worryabout that as well.

So when you talkabout scalability scaling up

and down is very easy asfar as AWS course

// ! security

again are now securityhas been a topic of debate
when you talk aboutWhat cloud services especially
but AWS puts allthose questions to rest.
It has great security mechanism.
Plus it provides youwith various compliance programs
that again help you take care
of security and when you talkabout real-time Security even
that is taken careof you can take care
of all the suspicious activities
that are there and not uaw'stakes care of all those things
and you're let free to focuson your business rather.
So these are the advantageswhich I feel that AWS adds value
to and apart from thatthe quite a few other points
1. we haveautomatic scheduling
2. I just mentioned you havevarious integrated apis.
Now these apis
3. are available indifferent programming languages
and that makes it architecturereally very strong to switch

from one programming languageto another so these are some



// ! Global architecture
it is very widely spreadand it covers almost every area
the architecture is dividedinto two major parts
that is Regionsand availability zones.
Now when you talkabout the regions
and availability zones reasons
are nothing but differentlocations across the world
where they have there.
Various data centers put up now.

As far as one region

goes it might havemore than one Data Center

and these data centersare known as
// !  availability Zone.

You being a consumer
or an individual youcan actually access
or access these Services
by sitting anywhere in the worldto give you an example.

If I'm sitting in some partof the world say,
for example, I amin Japan right now.
I can actually have accessto the services or data centers
that are there in u.s.

Right now.

So that is how it works.

You can choose your region.

Accordingly you can pick youravailability zones and use those

so you do not have to worryabout anything to throw

some more light on it.

You can take a lookat this small map

which is the global map and itshows the different places

which has its regionsand availability zones.

Now as far as this map goes,

I believe it's fairly old

and it has been upgradedin recent times

because AWS is putting a lot

of effort to havemore data centers

or more availability zonesas far as there.

Wide reach is concerned

and we can expect somein China as well.

So yes, they are actuallyreaching for and white.

So when you talkabout these regions

and availability zones,

if you take a look at this map

what you can see isyou have your reason

which is an orange color.

And the number that is inside.

It is the numberof availability zones

that they has to be nowto give you an example.

We have São Paulo,

which says that it hasthree availability zones,

so that is how it is

and the ones that arein the green Are the ones

which are comingsoon are the regions

that are in progress and someof these have actually gone.
I hadn't already started
or have been made available to people.
So yes, this ishow the architecture works
and this is how the databasearchitecture looks like.


// ! Domains of AWS.

// compute.

And when you talkabout compute the first thing
that should come to your mind is ec2 have a nice easy to it is elastic Cloud compute
and what it doesis it lets you have
// resizable compute capacity.

It's more of a raw server

where you can host a websiteand it is a clean slate.

Now.

What do I mean by this?

Say for example,you go ahead and buy a laptop.

It is a clean device

where you can haveyour own OS you can choose

which OS you want and allthose things accordingly.

Your ec2 is again a clean slate

and you can do somany things with it.

Now next you haveelastic Beanstalk with lets

you deploy your variousapplications on AWS.

And the only thing you needto know about this thing is

you do not have to worry aboutthe underlying architecture now,

it is very similar to your ec2.

And the only differencebetween the two is as

far as your elastic Beanstalkis Concern you can think

of it as something

that has predefined libraries.

Whereas your ec2 is

a clean slate when I saypredefined libraries say,

for example, you want to useJava as far as easy to goes.

Now.

This is just an example.

Don't take it literallywill have to say for example,

install everything fromthe beginning and start fresh.

But as far as your elasticBeanstalk is concerned

it has this predefined libraries

and you can just goahead and use those

because there's an underlyingSighing architecture,

which is defined.

Let me say it again.

I just give you an exampledon't take these sentences

literally so next

// ! Migration

we have migration when you talk about migration,
you need to understand one thing AWS has a global architecture and there would be requirement for migration And what aws does is it lets you have physical migration as well. That means you can physically move your data to the data center. Which you desire now,why do we need to do that? Say, for example,I am sending an email.Somebody I can do that through internet, but imagine if I have to give somebody a movie. So instead of sending it online. I can actually go aheadand give it to someoneif that person is means reachable for me and that way it would be more better for me. My data remains secure and so many other things so same is with data migration as well. And when you talk about AWS,
// ? it has somethingcalled as snowball
which actually lets you movethis data physically now, it's a storage service and it actually helps youin migration a lot security.


// ! compliance now when you talk about security,

we have various services. Like I have Iam , KMS nowwhen I say Iam it is nothing but your identification andauthentication management tool.
We have KMS which letsyou actually go ahead
and create your own publicand private keys
and that helps you keep
your system secure the quitea few other services as well,
but I would be mentioning oneor two services from each domain


// ! storage  
I talk about storage again AWS has quite a few services to offer to you.
We have something called as your S3 now s38 works as
a bucket object kind of a thing.
Your storage place is calledas a bucket and your object which you store in nothing,

but your files nowthese objects have to be stored

in their root files

which act as the bucketsbasically and then we

have something calledas your 
// ! cloudfront

which is nothing butyour content delivery Network.

We have somethingcalled as Glacier.

Now when you talk about Glacieryou can think of it as a place

where you can store archives

because it ishighly affordable next.

// ! networking
when you talk about networking.
We have services like VPC.
Direct Connect Route 53,
which is a DNS a

when I say VPC it isa virtual Network

which actually lets you moveor launcher resources.

That is your AWS resources.

Basically when you talkabout Direct Connect,

you can think of it as a least internet connection

which can be used with an AWS next on this list.

// ! We have somethingcalled as messaging.

Yes AWS Usher'ssecured messaging

and the quite a few applicationsto take care of that as well.

We have something called asCloud trial we have opsworks

all these things there.

Help you in messaging

or communicating withother parties basically

databases now storage and databases are similar,

but you have to understandone difference when you talk
 
about your storage
 
that is where you storeyour executable files.
 
So that is the differencebetween the two and
 
when you talk about databases,
 
we have somethingcalled as your Aurora,
 
which is something
 
which is very sql-likeand it lets you perform
 
various SQL optionsat a very faster rate
 
and what Amazon claims hasit is five times faster
 
than What aeschylus?
 
So yes, when you talk
 
about Aurora again a greatservice to have we also have
 
something called as

// ! Dynamo DBwhich is a non relational dbms.





When you talk aboutnon relational dbms,

I won't be discussing thatbut this helps you in dealing

with various unstructureddata sources as well.

Next on this list.

We have the last domainthat is the management tools.

Now when you talkabout 

// ! management tools,

// ! we have somethingcalled as cloudwatch,

which is a monitoring tooland it lets you set alarms

and all those Thosethings hopefully today

when we are done withthe demo part you'd be having

at least one partof your cloudwatch code

because we would be creatingalarms using Cloud was today.

So stay tuned for that as well.

So this is about AWS

and it's Basics as in the points,

which we just discussed

that as what it is its use has its advantages its domain

its Global architecture.

So you guys what I've doneis I've gone ahead

and I've switchedinto my AWS account.

The first thing youneed to understand is

// ! Practical

what AWS does is it offersyou a free tier now

while I was talking

about these things Ijust rush through it

because I know

that I was going to giveyou a demo on these things.

So and I wanted to discussthis thing in detail.

Now when you talk about AWS,

if you are a beginner,this is where you start now,

what aw does is it provides youwith its free tier

which is accessible

to you for Twelve monthsand the quite a few Services

which we just discussed

which are availableto you for free.

And when I say freethe certain limitations on it

as in these many hours is

what you can use it forand this is the amount of memory

or storage you can use in total

and all those thingsand its capacity

and everything based on that youhave different instances,

which you can createan all those things.

Now.

What aw is does is it givesyou these services for free?

And as long as youstay in the limits

that AWS has set youwon't be charged anything.

And trust me when it isfor learning purposes

that is more than enough andlet's quickly go ahead and take

a look at these Services first

and then there arefew other points,

which I would liketo discuss as well.

But firstly the freetier services and say this is

what it has to offerto you 12 months

of free and always free products

when you talk abouteasy to which is one

of its most popular computeServices 750 ours

and that is per month.

Next you have Amazon quick site,

which gives you 1 GBof spice capacity.

Now I won't get into the detailsof these things as an what

spice capacity isand all those things

when you have time,

I would suggest

that you go aheadand explore these things as in

what do these things do today?

We are going to focus moreon the easy to part.

So for now,

let's quickly takea look at these one

by one first Amazon RDS,

which is again,

which gives you send50 hours of your T,

2 micro instance Amazon S3,

which is a storagewhich again gives you 5 GB

of standard storage

and it w is Lambda1 million free request.

So there's someof the videos here actually

which would introduceyou to these things

that would help you get startedwith how to creating an account

and all those things and thisis the other important point

which I would like to mention.

When you do createan AWS account.

The first thing youneed to consider

as they would be asking youfor your credit card details.

So how does the login processwork firstly you go there

you doing your email IDand your basic details as in

why do you want to use itand all those things next?

What it would do is justto verify your account.

And it would ask youfor your credit card details,

even the debitcard details work.

I've actually tried thoseso you can go ahead

and give you a credit cardor debit card details.

And when you do thatwhat it does is it subtracts

a very small amountfrom your account.

I did this in India,

and I know that Iwas charged to rupees

which is fairly less

and that was againrefunded back to me

in two to three working days.

The only reason they cutthose two rupees was just

for the verification purpose

that my account is up

and running and I ama legitimate user.

Now as long as youstay in the limits,

you won't be charged anything.

But if you docross those limits,

you'll be charged.

Are you might beworried as an what?

If I do cross the limitwould I be charged?

Yes, you would bebut the fact is you

actually won't go beyond it.

And even if you doyou'll be notified seeing

that you are goingabout the limit

or about the limit.

Even when your freesubscription ends.

You are notified saying

that do you want to enteryour billing details?

And do you want to start billing

and if you say yes onlythen would be charged

for the subsequent.

Months and that isa very stringent process.

You don't haveto worry about it.

That is you won't be losing out

on any money as long as youfollow these rules.

So if you do not have

an account my suggestionwould be you go ahead.

You would log into AWS andcreate your free tier account

which has a very easyand two to three step process.

So guys, I would startthis session by talking about

what is an instancewould understand.

What is AWS ec2 servicewhich is core for us.

Standing instances in AWS.

Then we'll talkabout different types of

ec2 instances would understand

how instance pricing models work

and we'll take a lookat a use case

which would be followedby a demo that walks you

through all the stuffthat we have talked about.

So it is a fairly good content

and a lot of stuffto study today.
